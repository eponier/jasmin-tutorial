# Jasmin tutorial

## What this is

This is a tutorial for the
[Jasmin language](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin)
from a developer perspective. It introduces the Jasmin language, its philosophy,
and progressively the different constructs that the language offers.
It assumes the reader has some previous experience
with programming. Knowing C or Rust is certainly a plus.
Previous experience with assembly is also a plus, but some notions will be
introduced progressively, so you can probably learn on the go.

## What this is *not*

This is not an introduction to assembly. This is not an introduction to
cryptography. This is not an introduction to EasyCrypt. This will not provide
an end-to-end example showing how to combine Jasmin and EasyCrypt to write
high-assurance software. Other tutorials for these things exist (or will
hopefully exist).

This tutorial is far from finished. You can try to use it at your own risk!
